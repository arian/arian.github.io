I'm a senior Software Engineer at [Giftomatic](https://www.giftomatic.nl), where
I try to improve the search engine from smart algorithms, data processing, to
front-end. Previously I worked at [Symbaloo.com](https://www.symbaloo.com),
where I programmed stuff in Kotlin, Java, Elm, and JavaScript. I also
contributed to [MooTools](https://mootools.net), an Open Source JavaScript
framework, and I studied Mechanical Engineering and Embedded Systems at the
Technical University of Delft.

When I'm not behind a computer screen I like to ride my bike.
