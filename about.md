I am a Software Engineer from The Netherlands. I'm the Technical Team Lead at
[Symbaloo.com](https://www.symbaloo.com), where I program stuff in Kotlin,
Java, Elm, and JavaScript. In the past I contributed to
[MooTools](https://mootools.net), a Open Source JavaScript framework, and I
studied Mechanical Engineering and Embedded Systems at the Technical
University of Delft.

You can find me at other cool places too, like [twitter](https://twitter.com/astolwijk) or [GitHub](https://github.com/arian).
